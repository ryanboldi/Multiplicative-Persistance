# Multiplicative Persistance
 A genetic algorithm to find a number with very large multiplicative persistance: (how long it takes to boil down to a single digit)
 * 123 -> 1x2x3 = 6 (so this has MP of 1)
 *  6788 -> 6x7x8x8 = 2688 -> 2x6x8x8 = 768 -> 7x6x8 = 336 -> 3x3x6 = 54 -> 5x4 = 20 -> 2x0 = 0 (that's 6)
